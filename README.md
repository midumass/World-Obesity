# World Obesity

### Purpose
Obesity in the United States has long been in the news due to its association with health risks and the cost burden it places on the entire population.  Those health risks include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer that are some of the leading causes of preventable, premature death. Alongside the health-related problems is a drastic increase in cost. Compared with normal weight individuals, obese patients incur 46 percent increased inpatient costs, 27 percent more physician visits and outpatient costs, and 80 percent increased spending on prescription drugs. These costs are paid for by everyone, not just the obese individuals in question. 

This project looks at obesity rates and how they have changed over the past few decades, then predicts outcomes that could result if something isn't done to mitigate the current rate of growth.
