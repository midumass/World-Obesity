# World Obesity

### Purpose
With obesity becoming an epidemic in almost all reaches of the world including "starving" nations, this project aims to find correlations and causes. Understanding how the world is affected by obesity is the first step in figuring out why. 

### Technologies
* Python, plotly
* Time-Series and Statistical Analysis
* Data Visualizations

### Data
Two datasets were compiled to analyze the prevalence of obesity; one for the obesity numbers themselves, provided by the World Health Organization and one from the World Bank for population analysis. The two were merged to allow analysis of obesity by both country and raw population numbers. While both datasets are considered crude estimates, all should be relative.
